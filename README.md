This is a Portfolio Manager that was created as a dashboard for portfolio sites. It has already been implemented for two live client sites. These sites were adapted from the same core code that allowed the clients to upload their pictures, manage the order of the pictures and login to their secure dashboard.

This repository will be a implementation of this library, to make it more extensible for flexibility and application in portfolio websites.

Currently, written in PHP, jQuery UI and CodeIgniter version 2.x 

Version 1.0 - update to CodeIgniter 3.x
